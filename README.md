Racket plotter
==============

App to plot graphs of functions that can include integrals and also find roots.
It's written in Racket (Scheme (Lisp dialect) dialect).
Was made for a CS homework.
This code is not really good, but it contains some comments, so everything must be clear.
If you have any questions - write to me.
